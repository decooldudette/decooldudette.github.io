        Hello! My name is Emma H, and I am a rising senior at an Early College! I love all things STEM, but the arts have a special place in my heart. I hope to major and find a career in data science/statistics/machine learning. I love dance and taekwondo, as I have been doing these sports for most of my life! I hope to make a positive impact on those around me and the world as a whole! Nice to meet you!
