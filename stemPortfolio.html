        During the second semester of my junior year, I had the opportunity to work with college professors, college students, and my fellow high school classmates on a project involving artificial intelligence and a robot. The goal of the project was to create a robot that could detect and identify trash using AI in order to pick it up and keep beaches free from litter. Funded by the NC Sea Grant, we worked to optimize the machine learning model to correctly identify trash, implementing Python and ROS to make the robot autonomously move and pick up the item. This project had its challenges, ultimately leading to an unfinished product, but the process was informative and exciting nevertheless!
